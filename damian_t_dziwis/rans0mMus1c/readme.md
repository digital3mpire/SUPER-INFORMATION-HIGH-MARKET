# rans0mMus1c

The coming up of ransomware and especially recently one of the most prominent, WannaCry, 
let people question the value of their digital data by encrypting it and let them pay to get it back.

In rans0mMus1c the encryption by this malicious software becomes a creative process by reinterpreting encrypted audio-files 
of pop- and entertainment-music as audio- and videodata resulting in a new piece of visual music.
~This is done at first place with a encrypted audio-file of "Money Man" by A$AP Mob ft. A$AP Rocky and A$AP Nast.~
This is done with a encrypted audio-file of TOMM¥ CA$H "Euroz Dollaz Yeniz" on the second try.
See [metadata](_meta/metadata.md) file for detailed description of the process. 

Download the resulting visual music video in releases or watch it on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJlYr8uclV0


A linked crowdfunding campaign allows it, in case it raises enough money, to pay the demanded  bitcoin ransom in order
to free the original music piece from its blackmailer by decrypting the source audio-file back to its original state and to prevent all other files from being deleted!
